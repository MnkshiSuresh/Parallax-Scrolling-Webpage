                <p>Parallax scrolling is a web site trend where the background content (i.e. an image) is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling. Click on the links below to see the difference between a website with and without parallax scrolling.A typical website with a parallax effect is one in which the background of the website moves slower than the elements in the foreground. The visual effect we’re able to achieve gives the impression of movement and depth as if there is space between the foreground and background. At present, designers use parallax to achieve a variety of effects, such as enlarging or reducing components, fading in and out, or rotating 2D or 3D elements.<br></br>Parallax scrolling is a web site trend where the background content (i.e. an image) is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling.
